A simple tool designed to facilitate the visualization of median NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) values over the course of a year using Landsat-8 satellite data spanning from 2013 to 2022. With this app, you can also generate a time series of NDVI for any specific location you click on the map.
